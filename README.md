# 1_bit_ALU

Objective:

The objective of this lab is to design a bit slice 3-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Cadence as well as
using hierarchical design principles.
Lab Description and Specs:
Function:
Three-bit addition, subtraction, XOR (bitwise between A and B), and 3-bit shift-left (on A; shift in
zero at the least significant bit).
Inputs:
fun_sel0 and fun_sel1: Selects one of the four functions.
ain[2:0] and bin[2:0]: Inputs for the two 3-bit numbers or one 3-bit number.
Outputs:
out[2:0]: The three-bit number that is the result of the ALU operation.
